## alternative actors for die hard

If the original actor werenâ€™t in the role, here are some actors I think would be great:  

| Actor Name       | Why I Picked Them                | Age  |  
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----|  
| **Tom Cruise**     | **hes cool and plays a lot of action movie characters**                   | **61** |  
| **Keanu Reeves**     | **another cool and action oriented actor**                   | **59** |  
| **Harrison Ford**     | **the classic pick for action movies**                   | **81** |  
| **Chris Pratt**     | **although a bit younger, he also stars in action movies and is very cool**                   | **44** |
